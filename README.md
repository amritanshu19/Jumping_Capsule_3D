C# scripts for my first Jumping Capsule 3D game created using Unity engine
Unity is a popular game engine which comes with a lot of features like physics engine, scripting etc.

Controls: Space - for jumping, A - move backwards, D - move forwards (also arrow keys can be used for forward/backward movement instead of A/D respectively)
This is a simple 3D game which has obstacles and coins. A user needs to clear the obstacle and collect the coin to increase his/her score.
